4732-FRC2014
============

Team #4732's source code for the 2014 FIRST Robotics Competition. This year's competition is Aerial Assist and we are using a command-based system for functioning our robot.

This year, we decided to go full offensive. Our robot is 4'11" and launches the game piece via a catapault on a winching system (using surgical tubing as our rubber bands).
